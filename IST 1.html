	<h2>The Task </h2>
	<p>
		Our objective was to make a website to display our work in class and asssessment work for the
		next 2 years of IST. The website must be written from scratch using html. The website is to be
		be submitted as a github link and should funtion properly as a website. Meanin that it is simple
		to navigate and it should also pe visually apealing to the viewer. It will serve as a e-portfolio.
		The website is graded by the style of the website, the grammar and the contents. Additionally you will
		also need to supply documentation regarding the proscess of designing and making the website. It
		requires you to submit things like your planning, your understanding of the contraints and a breakdown
		of the final completed product.

			Part 1
		</h2>
		<p>
			The constraint mainly consists of the time constraints and the technology. Sometimes a computer might break 
			down or the internet is down. Other constraints can be the coding skills of the developer, whether they can 
			produce a website that looks aesthetically pleasing or they can only create simple unattractive websites. The
			time contraints mean that we have to learn different skills in html and use them in ourwebsite in around a 10
			week period to do all of that. This time includes planning and research about the website. Then you have to allow
			2-3 weeks to make the website and perfect it this takes a total of around 9 weeks to do all of this. The only contraints
			of concern are the time contrainsts and the abillyty of the developer.
