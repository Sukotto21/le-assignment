		<h2> About the WWW (World Wide Web)</h2>
		<p>
		The World wide web is a way of accessing information on the internet. It is not a form of hardware but instead
		like a software. It is run by many protocols and the one that is used most often is HTTP which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol
		this is a protocol to transfer data throughout the internet and is usually a transfer between a server and a client.
		Most webpages we find on the web are made by a language called HTML. The web is all about transferring this HTML so 
		we can see it. Bassiclly the web is a form of accessing the internet.
